                                <p>Floods in Bangladesh worsen, killing 18. The flooding is due to tectonic plates
                                    uplifting in the Himalayas, increasing sediment erosion. The eroded sediment then
                                    clogs up the
                                    channel, impeding natural water flow.
                                </p>
                                <p>Muddy waters are up to chest height, and water floods 11 districts, submerging around
                                    1.5
                                    million people.
                                </p>
                                <p>The flood was originally thought to be "displayed inhumanity" by India, where India
                                    purposefully opened the dam without warning. However, according to CNN, the flooding
                                    was
                                    "primarily" the result of water flow in areas of the Gumti River. It was also said
                                    to be due to
                                    the overflowing of rivers and extreme monsoon rains.
                                </p>

                    <h4 id="mdo"><b>Hasina Flees - August 2024</b></h4>
                    <p>The Prime Minister of Bangladesh of 15+ years, Sheikh Hasina, finally resigned and later fled
                        after nation-wide movements and dangerous protests occurred. In her replacement, an interim
                        government was formed to govern the country. The movement was led entirely by young
                        students,
                        marking the progression of power to a new younger, determined, and dynamic generation.
                    </p>
                    <p> Without a proper government, new problems arise. Arms and dangerous weapons are now easily
                        obtainable by anyone, making robberies and crime much more prevalent.
                    </p>
                    <p>Currently, the ex-PM is hiding out in India.</p>


                    <br></br>


                    <!-- Topic 3 -->
                    <h4 id="one"><b>The Aftermath of Hasina - August/September 2024</b></h4>
                    <p>After Hasina fled to India, Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus has been in power. During Hasina's
                        rule, hundreds of missing persons had been reported, completely disappearing. </p>
                    <p>During Hasina's rule, she had signed the CHT Accord that promised sovereignty to the Chakma
                        people in 1997, a minority of Bangladesh that had been fighting for their rightful land.
                        However, many of the Chakmas believed they continued to be taken advantage of, and therefore
                        critisized Hasina. Among those who critisized Hasina was Chakma, who was mysteriously abducted
                        in 2019. He was kept in solitary confinement for 5 years, where he thought he would die. After
                        Hasina's fleeing, however, he was finally freed, and was later able to reunite with family. </p>
                    <p>Two others who were abducted under Hasina's rule were also freed. These two people were abducted
                        due to the fact that they were leaders of a Muslim party associated with Pakistan, and were
                        therefore banned by Hasina. However, Yunis's government has just lifted the ban, freeing them.
                    </p>
                    <p>It's safe to say that the future of Bangladesh has much more promise under Yunis, but that
                        doesn't mean the future is secured.</p>
